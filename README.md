# stop edging

this isnt what we meant by edging anyway

[remove edge](https://github.com/yeenbean/stop-edging/releases/latest)

## how it works

microsoft edge is removed using the same process done by [privacy.sexy](https://privacy.sexy/):

1. edge is uninstalled using the official uninstaller's hidden flags.
2. file and url associations with edge are removed.
3. shortcuts for edge are removed.

after edge is removed, you will have the option to install firefox. the script is smart enough to grab the version of firefox which suits your architecture.

## like the script?

this project wouldn't exist without [privacy.sexy](https://privacy.sexy/). support their project by starring the [repository](https://github.com/undergroundwires/privacy.sexy) and leaving a contribution.
